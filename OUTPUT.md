 Clinical Trials Discussion Thread - Week of 2021-07-18
Post Content: Here you can talk about specific clinical trials, random studies or experiences with them, or the clinical trials process like recruitment, compensation etc.

Comment: My trial has had a rash of people canceling their study day appointments last minute! This costs me $200 in cancellation fees. I can’t charge them these fees since they are volunteering their time. Any suggestions on steps to take? We already send out plenty of reminders and communicate openly.

Comment: Do clinical trials care if you smoke weed?

Comment: FYI:  Sent to the NLM / [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) help desk:
Subject: Please better cooperate with search engine web spiders rather than blocking them with your robots.txt file.
Hi.
I have had trouble finding your site's content. I find that [https://www.google.com/search?q=NCT04510324+site%3Agov](https://www.google.com/search?q=NCT04510324+site%3Agov)  currently shows:
https://clinicaltrials.gov › show › NCT04510324
No information is available for this page.
Learn why
The second link indicates that the reason for the lack of info is that the page is blocked by Robots.txt, and indeed, your robots.txt file contains:Disallow: /ct2/which matches [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324), and so search engines don't index it properly because you are blocking access to it.
Also, this poor result is an improvement over the situation a few months ago, when the result was:
Your search - NCT04510324 site:gov - did not match any documents.
This is a very bad result. Even today,
[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy+NCT04510324](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy+NCT04510324)  shows that result.
Oddly, I also find that your website does not make a sitemap available to search engine web spiders.
It should; see [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) , for example.
A proper sitemap will allow such searches to work in popular search engines.
This is a rather new problem - a regression in functionality as a result of recent changes. For years such searches have always worked for me. Can you please address it? Please put up a standard sitemap and/or don't block access to /ct2/ URLs.
I did find a workaround is to go to the site and search for the trial there - [https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT04510324)  but I still think this is a problem that impacts many users and should be fixed. ClinicalTrials.gov content should not be hidden from users of common internet search tools - those of google, bing, yahoo, baidu, etc.

 Any clinical trials available for a man who is dying of bowel cancer?
Post Content: John Bain(AKA TotalBiscuit) is a truly amazing person who unfortunately has been suffering from bowel cancer for the last four years. He's kept it at bay so far due to chemotherapy, alas the chemo treatments recently stopped working and now his liver is said to be failing. He has been trying to get into clinical trials but so far he's been turned down due to them being uncomfortable taking on someone in his condition.

I was wondering if anyone on here knows of any clinical trials that would be willing to take John?  I know this is a longshot and the odds for him are not great, but I figured it was at least worth a try.

Comment: Well, 'uncomfortable' probably means 'not meeting inclusion criteria'. You'll need far more detailed information to find out if someone is eligible for open clinical trials, so he can best ask his doctor.

Title:
 Self pay test that healthcare professionals will take seriously?
Post Content: Based on running raw 23andme data through some databases, I believe my husband may have Lynch Disorder, which increases his chances of cancer.  However he does not meet the criteria to have a genetic test done professionally through the healthcare system (no family members with known cancer, no one in the family to have the syndrome).

I am willing to self-pay for a genetic test assuming it is reasonable.  I see there are whole genome sequencing tests out there for around $600-$1000.  Is there a specific test that healthcare professionals will take seriously if I brought in and which insurance will accept?  For example, if I self pay for a genetic test at X, I would like my husband be able to bring the results to his doctor and insurance and be able to qualify for more/earlier screening.  Can I get this done?  What company would be best?

&#x200B;

Thank you!

Comment: There are some reputable genetic testing companies that offer patient-initiated testing with a reasonable self-pay price. For example, Invitae offers a [cancer screening test](https://www.invitae.com/us/staying-healthy/about-our-tests) for $299. Invitae is a reputable lab that is used by many clinicians for Lynch syndrome testing, and this patient-initiated screening test uses the same technology as the diagnostic tests ordered by doctors. The main difference is the screening test does not report on Variants of Uncertain Significance - it will only tell you if you have a known disease-causing variant in a cancer gene. I believe once you order the test, you fill out some personal information (personal and family history, any previous genetic testing results, etc) and a doctor will review all the information prior to approving the test and contact you with any additional questions or concerns. There is also genetic counseling available.

Be forewarned- there is a very high false positive rate for running your 23andMe raw data through other programs. Many people do not even have the genetic variants that are seen in the raw data (23andMe doesn’t report this data for a reason), and even if the variant is actually present, reputable labs often classify it differently than what you see in  Promethease (or whatever other program).

Regardless, I recommend meeting with a doctor or genetic counselor to explore your husband’s risk and possible additional genetic testing options.

Comment: If you tell me that on one hand there’s zero family history of colon cancer, but on the other hand you have recreational genetics run through databases by an amateur, I’m going to strongly lean toward the lack of family history being more accurate.

Comment: There are clinical tests for cancer susceptibility that are fairly affordable through Invitae and Color. These are the same labs used by genetic counsellors. If you are worried about Lynch, test for Lynch and don’t go opening Pandora’s box with whole genome sequencing. You can get pan-cancer panels that are validated and accurate that include Lynch from both labs.

Comment: He could see a genetic counselor. Likely you will have to pay out of pocket for the testing, but they can help guide testing and discuss risks, benefits, limitations....

Comment: One more option would be JScreen. It’s run through Invitae, but their cancel panel is $199 for anyone with health insurance, and they do report variants of unknown significance as well as provide access to genetic counselors.

Comment: Invitae’s self pay price for basically any genetic test you could want is $250. Their health screen is $350. I recommend making an appointment with a genetic counselor (I am one) to discuss all of this information further, take a family history, and help you get this test. There may be things in the family history that don’t seem suspicious until it’s all put together. NSGC.org is a great place to start 😊 Genome Medical is another place that can do counseling + testing virtually.

Comment: As mentioned above, Color is another reputable company that offers what you are potentially looking for

Comment: Also, raw data analysis with 23andMe has about a 50/50 chance of being accurate. A legitimate test will confirm this finding (or not)

Comment: Seconding JScreen

Comment: Myriad's Myrisk test is $249 out of pocket and will provide expert analysis of the Lynch genes. That test needs a health care provider's signature though.

You should also look at what exact mutation was found and see if it's actually a pathogenic mutation. You're looking for a "c dot" number, which should look like "c.123A>G" or something. You can Google that c dot and the gene name, or call 18004MYRIAD, extention 3850, and ask if they have seen that variant in that gene.

With no family history of cancer and the 3rd party analysis being the only findings, there's like a 99% chance this isn't a real mutation

Comment: [c.163delC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs63750337) and it's the MSH2 gene.  SNP [rs63750337](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs63750337).  I have googled it and best I can tell it's a concern but reading the studies is definitely above my head!  I'll try and give them a call though, that's a great idea, thank you!

Comment: I've done genetic testing for people in a clinic after they "found" something like that and it turns out that they didn't even have the mutation they thought they had. It's super common, the false positive rate is staggering.

Comment: Here's the ClinVar entry for MSH2 c.163delC
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/90712/?oq=NM_000251.3:c.163delC&m=NM_000251.3(MSH2):c.163del%20(p.Arg55fs)

You could also ask those companies others listed if they would test for a specific variant if you only want to see if the 23andme was correct. It might be cheaper than a whole cancer panel. If you go that route give them the full nomenclature of NM_000251.3 c.163delC. The NM# is the transcript and they need that to make sure they are looking at the right region for a specific variant.

Based on the ClinVar entry this does look like a concerning variant and it would be good to follow up either by convincing your doctor (maybe print out the ClinVar page) or by paying for testing yourself so you have an official report with a classification and interpretation.

Title:
 At what point should I be worried about inbreeding? (And is there a test for it?)
Post Content: I'm from India and culturally there is a practice among certain communities where children are frequently married to their cousins and uncles. I remember my mum talking about this quite casually when I was young but avoids the subject at all costs these days.

I'm not particularly close to her side of the family, but from our limited interactions I would not be surprised at all if this was a practice they follow. My sister got married this month and I met one of our cousins for the first time in years. He introduced me to his wife's family and I was shocked by the obvious family resemblances that they all share.

I know that this isn't quite "The hills have eyes" because we're essentially physically healthy, but I have noticed that there are far more psychiatric issues on my mum's side. My other cousin has serious developmental issues and multiple diagnoses and can barely function. My sister and I have struggled with anxiety. depression and mild ADHD all our lives. The adults don't exactly "believe" in mental health but their symptoms are obvious to me at least - the most obvious is my uncle who hasn't left the house in years, but even the least symptomatic of them have gotten REALLY slow with time.

I'm moving to Canada soon and one of the things that I really want to do is take advantage of the better tools in healthcare available there. My primary focus would be therapy and ADHD meds, but I really am curious about whether there is any specific genetic test for this. (Ideally some sort of % of inbreeding kind of thing?) Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might approach this?

Asking my family members to get themselves proper diagnoses isn't possible - both because of their repeated refusals, and the poor state of psychiatric services in India.

Comment: Most concerns with inbreeding is lose of genetic diversity. This usually would result in recessive conditions where both parents are carriers of a condition and if they each pass it on their children would be affected. Most issues we know of are early onset conditions with severe defects and/or illness early in life. There is also greater chance dominant conditions will popup if parents are affected. One way to assess for the recessive risk would be a chromosome microarray to look for areas of similar DNA sequences due to shared ancestors. These areas can then be looked at for potential recessive conditions in these areas. Something like ADHD would not be something contributed to these areas or available for genetic testing at this time. It is believed to be multifactorial with some genetic and some environmental factors. If you do not have any major health concerns, genetic testing isn't likely to indicate a condition that would be a concern related to inbreeding.

Comment: "One way to assess for the recessive risk would be a chromosome microarray to look for areas of similar DNA sequences due to shared ancestors."

Thanks. I'll start looking into that.



 I know that ADHD isn't necessarily genetic, but considering the resources I'm working with I can't rely too heavily on any diagnosis at the moment.

My basic concern is that there absolutely  is a issue of some sort on that side of the family (which may be cultural, learned behavior or an undiagnosed genetic issue). All their kids are absolute hellions and as everyone gets older they  become extremely taciturn and belligerent. Because of the intermarrying issue this is just something that I really want to rule out while still focusing on more traditional modes of therapy

Comment: The above post was a perfect answer. If your parents are related, it will be picked on a microarray test on yourself. Basically some stretches of your DNA will be identical (homozygous) across both chromosomes. That’s why there’s risk of rare recessive genetic syndromes. Examples of recessive conditions would be cystic fibrosis, beta thalassemia, tay sachs etc.

There is not really any clinical utility for you to get a microarray. Having family members that are taciturn/moody is not a genetic disease… if you are healthy, a microarray won’t tell you anything useful. Best thing you can do is not marry/have kids within your family.

Edit to add that I just saw the part about the cousin with severe developmental issues. She would actually be a good candidate to have tested with a microarray and potentially have additional gene sequencing.

Comment: ADHD actually does have a strong genetic component, related to neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. DAT1, DRD 4/5, 5-HTTLPR…

Comment: Thank you. Would this provide visible results even if my parents aren't related?. I don't think they are. My concern is that my mums family has practiced intermarrying for so long that we have inherent genetic issues.

When I say taciturn/moody, I'm really understating it. It's more like extremely severe emotional dysregulation. They alternate between shutting down entirely and exploding. I just didn't want to share personal/traumatic family stories on the internet.

Comment: No it will only tell if your parents are related.

Having psychiatric issues can cluster in families, but in most cases there’s no single genetic cause. Things like bipolar disorder for example are multifactorial - having an affected family member increases risk slightly but different environmental factors play a role.

Genetic testing won’t give you the answers you are looking for.

 Advice for doctor going into clinical genetics from psychiatry
Post Content: I recently got accepted to clinical genetics training/residency in the UK, starting in August

I am very excited about this as I love the speciality, however I have been working in psychiatry training for the last 5 years or so, so I think i need to brush up on my internal medicine and pediatrics.

Could any clinical geneticist recommend how best for me to use the next few months to prepare?


Comment: At bare minimum learn where the field of clinical genetics is at currently. The capabilities and limits NGS technology. More in-depth genetics (e.g. imprinting, splicing, structural variants).

Note: this is just where I personally see a knowledge gap for clinical genetics physicians and this may not be necessary depending on your individual goals

Title:
 NYC Genetics Labs
Post Content: Hi All! There are several major hospitals in the NYC area: Columbia, NYP, NYU, Mount Sinai. Which one of these hospitals has the best clinical genetics department? And how do you evaluate which lab to choose (putting aside insurance)? Thanks!

Comment: Are you looking for labs or clinics? A lot of clinical genetics departments send most of their testing to an outside lab

Comment: Adding to other comment that most tests are sent to outside labs and labs vary by types of tests. If you want good clinicians (medical geneticists and genetic counsellors) Mt Sinai has a comprehensive genetics programme ranging from rare disease to prenatal to cancer. It’s been 15 years since I worked there, but I don’t recall any of the other centres you listed having the same breadth of service. If you’re looking for cancer genetics, don’t forget about MSKCC.

Comment: Is this for an adult or child? I took my son to Dr Jessica Davis at Mt Sinai’s genetics department and wasn’t thrilled with the appointment. She had two syndromes she suspected (Angelmans and Fragile X) and both were negative and she had no other ideas. We didn’t do whole  exome or genome, just those 2 specific tests. Wendy Chung at Columbia (Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital) has a stellar reputation. We haven’t gotten in to see her yet.

Comment: Ah right. I guess both? I’d like to go to a hospital with the best clinicians but also use good labs. Is it possible to get both?

Comment: Thanks! I was leaning towards Mt. Sinai. They use Prevention Genetics for whole exome and whole genome testing. Is this a good lab?

Comment: Thank you! It’s for an adult. Does Wendy Chung see adults?

Comment: Every lab has pros and cons depending on what is being ordered. Prevention genetics is a reputable lab in that they are CLIA and CAP certified, so results are clinical grade (but you would expect any genetics department to be using clinical grade testing). I do want to note that genetics professionals do not typically order exome/genome sequencing as a first line test, so depending on your clinical history you may end up with different testing, or no testing.

Comment: She’s only peds, unfortunately. It seems she left Columbia last year to be head of peds at Harvard.

Comment: Thank you. This is helpful. Is there a resource that lists the pros and cons or strengths of each of the clinical grade labs? Or where can I find out more about how the labs differ? Thx!

Comment: Not a singular resource that I know of. It’s more that certain labs have well-known expertise in certain indications, so it really depends on what the test is for. Additionally, each lab has different reporting practices. I would trust that whatever genetics professional you see will order what is most appropriate.

Post Content: I’m looking for some career advice. I recently completed my PhD in molecular biology, and have a goal of completing a Laboratory Genetics and Genomics Fellowship. I didn’t apply this cycle and am looking to strengthen my application as I know these programs are *very* competitive (one program said they received 100 applications for 2 positions).


I am currently doing a postdoc in the genetics field, but there were some unexpected problems with the funding, and my funding will run out by the beginning of fall.


My PhD is in molecular biology, not genetics, but my research focused on cancer genomics and genetics. I also have a strong programming background, but not a ton of wet lab research experience. I am worried that will hurt me as a lot of the LGG curriculum seems to focus on wet lab techniques.


I would deeply appreciate any advice or ideas on how to strengthen my application. What type of jobs should I apply for? Is there anyone here who has successfully applied for an LGG fellowship? Thanks.

Comment: Hi! I'm in my first year of training in the Canadian equivalent. The best thing I did to get accepted for the training position was to first contact individuals in the lab to get an idea of why they do in a day and what skills they expected candidates to have. Because my name was then on their minds, when a post doc position came up, I applied and was accepted for that. After being in that position for a year doing clinical genetics, I was much more prepared for the training program and was accepted.

I think it would also be good to look up the requirements of the training program sooner rather than later and prioritize positions that will allow you to get relevant wet lab experience.

Happy to chat more if you have any other questions!

Comment: Apply for jobs in a clinical genetics lab, especially a lab that trains fellows, if there are any near you.  The fellowship programs have become competitive to the point that some programs are recruiting phds to work with the lab for a year or two before starting fellowship.  A clinical genetics lab that doesn’t do fellowship training will also be good.  Clinical laboratory genetics is a small community, so you can benefit from the connections the director of the lab has to training programs, as well as adding relevant experience to your cv.

Be open to non-PhD roles, if the experience will be right.  For example, I worked in a technologist role after graduating, and then was accepted to a fellowship (at a different institution)within a couple years. The experience gave me new relevant skills that were incredibly helpful in the first year of fellowship, and a better understanding of the differences between a clinical lab and a research lab. Also I’m certain the recommendation of the lab director was critical to my acceptance into the program.

Comment: I’m LGG boarded and am faculty for a LGG fellowship program. Happy to answer questions on the fellowship via dm.

Comment: Thank you for your answer!  When you contacted these lab members, did you already know them or was it sort of a cold email situation? I do have some contacts but I haven’t been as persistent in keeping in contact with them as perhaps I should have. 


I have been looking for requirements for the application but they are oddly brief from what I’ve seen: just mentioning a PhD or MD, need to be an American citizen or permanent resident. And that obviously can’t be the full story, haha. 

Comment: This is really good advice. A Postdoc in a clinical genetics lab that does the fellowship seems to be the way to go. Thank you so much! 

Comment: It was a cold email saying that I was interested in learning more!

As for the requirements, I more meant the requirements once you are in training. For instance, as part of my training, I have to set up x amount of cultures, PCRs, MLPAs, etc - it might be helpful to know what will be required of you during training so you can try to gain as much wet lab experience in those areas beforehand.

The requirements for the application are also vague here. I reached out to the coordinators for each centre to determine if they had any particular things they liked to have as part of the application.

Comment: You’re welcome, good luck!!

Title:
 Newborn Screen Elevated C5OH
Post Content: My son’s newborn screening revealed elevated C5OH (1.37 micromol/L, normal <1.15). Upon further testing his blood levels still indicated elevated C5OH levels with negative presence of urine analytes. Because of this, current doctors claim he is either a carrier or asymptomatic for possible conditions but do not seem confident in their prognosis because they are puzzled by the absence of analytes. They said they can’t even diagnose his condition and the cheek swab they could offer to potentially sequence his gene (dna? I don’t remember) is only 60% accurate.

I am a layperson only equipped with google to understand what this means. We will likely not be seen for 8+ months and I’m very concerned for my son who is 4 weeks old. I do not know what symptoms to look for or what I should be concerned about if something arises.

Can anyone offer any insight into the validity of this prognosis and what I should be looking out for?

Comment: >Newborn screening has also revealed a more subtle biochemical phenotype (type II pattern), characterized by only mild increases in C5-OH and 3-methylcrotonylglycine. In addition, newborn screening has identified a large number of “maternal 3-MCC deficiency” cases whereby screen-positive newborns were actually reflecting a deficiency of the enzyme in their asymptomatic mothers. 

Comment: This appointment with the newborn screening specialist should not take 8 months. Have your child's doctor call the genetics doctor personally and get you in sooner.

Comment: This was super helpful, thank you! I (mother) screened negative for 3 MCC on my gestational carrier screening as well as blood and urine when my son was tested

Title:
 fragile X carrier
Post Content: I did genetic testing, and I (a female who is pregnant) was determined to have 46 repeats of fragile X. My husband was not tested, but it is clear he does not have the full-blown syndrome (neither do I). What does this look like for my children in terms of 1) probability of them too being carriers and 2) is it possible for them to have any fragile X symptoms?

Comment: The answer is quite complicated, because it involves both X-linked inheritance and repeat expansion. I would strongly recommend discussing this with a genetic counselor.

Obligatory disclaimer that this is not medical advice.

>probability of them too being carriers

Assuming that one of your two X chromosomes has 46 *FMR1* CGG repeats, and the other X chromosome has normal repeat size (up to 44 repeats - this should be indicated in your report), you have 50% chance of transmitting the X chromosome with 46 repeats to your male and female offspring (i.e., them being a carrier). During the transmission, the repeat may expand, contract, or stay at the same size.

>is it possible for them to have any fragile X symptoms

Per [GeneReviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1384/), "to date no transmission of alleles with 55 or fewer repeats is known to have resulted in an affected individual". Thus your male offspring is not at risk for fragile X syndrome (>200 repeats). Assuming your husband does not have premutation (55-200 repeats), your female offspring is also not at risk for fragile X syndrome (>200 repeats).

However, if your X chromosome with 46 repeats expanded into premutation range (55-200 repeats) in your offspring, they may be at risk of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in both males and females, and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in females. Their offspring would be at risk for fragile X syndrome (>200 repeats).

Risk of further repeat expansion is attenuated by the presence of AGG interruptions in the CGG repeat sequence. There are clinical tests available to determine whether AGG interruptions are present in your X chromosome with 46 repeats.

Comment: What lab did your testing? Many labs have free genetic counseling services that can explain the results to you and answer your questions.
